* **Machine Learning:** Scikit-Learn
* **Development Environment:** Jupyter Notebook, VS Code



## Project Documentation

### 1. Data Analysis and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* **Coffee Shop Sales Analysis**: 
    * Performed data cleaning and time-series analysis on daily sales.
    * Identified peak business hours and seasonal trends to optimize operational efficiency.
* **Customer Churn Investigation**: 
    * Analyzed customer retention factors using correlation matrices and heatmaps.
    * Identified key variables influencing user attrition.

### 2. Machine Learning Implementations
* **Regression (Housing Price Prediction)**: 
    * Developed a Linear Regression model to forecast property values.
    * Evaluated performance using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R-squared scores.
* **Classification (Titanic Survival)**: 
    * Applied Logistic Regression and Random Forest algorithms.
    * Implemented advanced feature engineering and handled missing data through statistical imputation.
* **Clustering (Customer Segmentation)**: 
    * Utilized K-Means clustering to identify distinct customer personas based on historical purchasing behavior.
